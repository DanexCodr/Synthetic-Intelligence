Definition: a geometric representation of the complex numbers established by the real axis and the orthogonal imaginary axis
Example: it can be thought of as a modified Cartesian plane, with the real part of a complex number represented by a displacement along the x-axis, and the imaginary part by a displacement along the y-axis
