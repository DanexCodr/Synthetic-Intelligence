Definition: the force experienced by a point charge moving along a wire that is in a magnetic field
Example: the force is at right angles to both the current and the magnetic field; the Lorentz force can be used to suspend a current-carrying object between two magnets
Synonyms: force, the, experienced, by, a, point, charge, moving, along, wire, that, is, in, magnetic, field, at, right, angles, to, both, current, and, Lorentz, can, be, used, suspend, current-carrying, object, between, two, magnets
