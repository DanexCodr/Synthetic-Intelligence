Definition: physics) a quantum of energy or quasiparticle that can be propagated as a traveling wave in nonlinear systems and is neither preceded nor followed by another such disturbance
Example: does not obey the superposition principle and does not dissipate; soliton waves can travel long distances with little loss of energy or structure
